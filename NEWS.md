# Version 0.4-8
## New features
* This is a maintenance release with bug fixes and some changes in compiler settings


# Version 0.4-7
## New features
* This is primarily an update to address a C++14 vs C++17 compilation issue identified by CRAN

* But bugs from 0.4-6 have also been fixed

## Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
* Sampling from the priors (prisamp = TRUE) fails for models with meanstructure = FALSE; the posterior is still estimated (reported by Armel Brizuela Rodríguez).

* For target = "jags", models with a single-indicator latent variable, where the latent variable is regressed on other variables, return incorrect parameter estimates (reported by Brad Cosentino).


# Version 0.4-6
## New features
* For target = "stan", meanstructure=FALSE is allowed, along with use of sample.cov and sample.nobs instead of raw data

* Users are warned about priors on covariance matrices that are neither diagonal nor unrestricted

* For models where observed variable intercepts appear in the latent intercept vector (alpha), default priors come from the observed intercept vector nu (as the user would expect)

* inits = "simple" is now default (instead of "prior"), to address some convergence problems

* For stan targets, ":=" can now be used as an identity function

* For target = "stan", fix the missing data issue from 0.4-3 (complete data in one group but not the other)

* Column names are added to blavPredict(, type="lv")

## Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
* blavFitIndices() and save.lvs = TRUE do not work correctly for models without meanstructure. Workaround is to use meanstructure = TRUE in the model estimation command (reported by Charles Hofacker).

* The lavaan summary() method is sometimes called instead of the blavaan summary() method (reported by multiple users, with Shu Fai Cheung providing helpful examples).



# Version 0.4-3
## New features
* For target = "stan", most models should run faster than they did in earlier versions (use of sufficient statistics)

* Posterior summaries are faster for ordinal models (using mnormt::sadmvn() by default)

* Variational Bayes option added: target="vb", which uses rstan::vb()

* cmdstanr functionality added: target="cmdstanr", which uses the model from target="stan"

* Fix blavInspect(., "lvs"/"lvmeans") for multiple groups + missing data

* Fixes to ppmc() for ordinal models; blavFitIndices() turned off for ordinal models (more research needed)

* loo() moment matching available by passing mcmcextra = list(data = list(moment_match_k_threshold))

## Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
* target = "stan" fails when there are complete data in one group and missing data in another group (reported by Ronja Runge).

* blavPredict(, type="ymis") still not available for models with ordinal variables



# Version 0.4-1
## New features
* Functionality for ordinal observed variables is now available.

* For models with missing data, posterior summaries have been sped up (log-likelihood computations now done in Stan).

##  Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
* blavPredict(, type="ymis") is not working for models with ordinal variables

* blavInspect(, 'lvs') or (, 'lvmeans') can fail for models with a combination of multiple groups, missing values, and excluded cases

* blavFitIndices() and ppmc() are not working for models with ordinal variables, or may indicate excessively bad fit

* blavFitIndices(, rescale="mcmc") fails



# Version 0.3-18
## New features
* This version adds a reference to the new JSS paper, including DOI, and corrects an inconsistent version dependency. There are no other changes as compared to 0.3-17.


# Version 0.3-17
## New features
* This is a maintenance release to correct major bugs from the previous version.


# Version 0.3-16
## New features
* blavPredict() function added for predicting latent variables and missing data.

* Some posterior summaries are sped up. (and fitMeasures are available when test="none")

* bug fixes from the previous version.

##  Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
* For certain models with missing data, ppp-values are incorrect (sometimes equaling 1.0).

* For target="stan", some multiple group models fail when some cases are missing all observed variables (reported by DeAnne Hunter).


# Version 0.3-15
## New features
* Added an S3 summary() method for ppmc

* Posterior intervals summary() bug is fixed

##  Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
* The summary() method for ppmc() and fitIndices() does not always work correctly.

* A Jacobian was incorrect for target="stan", when (non-default) priors were placed on precisions or variances instead of on standard deviations. This could impact estimates of posterior variability (reported by Roy Levy).


# Version 0.3-14
* (version 0.3-13 violated a CRAN policy)

## New features
* This is a maintenance release in response to a change in package Matrix.

##  Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
* Posterior intervals are NA in summary(). Workarounds are to use parameterEstimates() (intervals assuming posterior normality) or to compute them yourself using the posterior samples (`blavInspect(fit, "mcmc")')
	

# Version 0.3-12
* (version 0.3-11 failed Windows CRAN checks)

## New features
* vector values of wiggle.sd are allowed for different priors on approximate
      equality constraints

* logical argument "prisamp" added, for sampling from a model's prior

* for target="stan", lkj prior is used for unrestricted lv correlation matrices

* default priors for conditional approaches (targets jags and stanclassic) revert to being placed on precisions (as opposed to SDs), for improvement in sampling efficiency
	


# Version 0.3-10
## New features
* save.lvs=TRUE works for missing data under target="stan"

* new arguments "wiggle" and "wiggle.sd" for approximate equality constraints under target="stan"
   
## Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
* plot labels for target="stan" are sometimes incorrect (displaying a parameter different from the panel label).

* complex equality constraints are sometimes ignored (target="jags" or "stanclassic")

* equality constraints with std.lv=TRUE sometimes fail (target="stan")

* placing priors on variances or precisions yields incorrect results (target="stan"; reported by Roy Levy)


# Version 0.3-9
## New features
* improvements to save.lvs=TRUE for target="stan".
   
* target="stancond" is added, which is an experimental, noncentered Stan approach.
   
* bug fixes for prior settings and std.lv in target="stan", and defined parameters.
   
## Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
* For target="stan", problems with sampling lvs when there are multiple groups or missing data.

* Errors for blavCompare() and blavFitIndices() due to version updates of other packages.

      variances, standard deviations, or precisions.

* plot() now works uniformly across Stan and JAGS, relying on bayesplot.

* post-MCMC parallelization is now handled via future.apply package
      (requires an extra "plan" command from user, but works on windows).

## Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
* blavInspect(, 'lvmeans') returns rows in the wrong order for target="stan" (reported by Mehdi Momen).

* User-specified priors sometimes are placed on the wrong parameter, for target="stan" (reported by Enrico Toffalini).

* For target="jags", lv means obtained from blavInspect() (via argument 'lvmeans') are incorrect. (reported by Mauricio Garnier-Villareal)

* Use of plot() with target="stan" causes problems for future blavInspect() calls.

# Version 0.3-3
## New features
* For convergence="auto", max time was previously 5 min (undocumented). It is now Inf.
	
* Axis labels (parameter names) are now more sensible on convergence plots.

* Relative effective sample size now used to compute loo/waic SEs, and some SEs are now returned via fitMeasures().

* Added unit testing via package testthat.

* Fixed bugs from 0.3-2 (with exception of identity assignments using ':=')
