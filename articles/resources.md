Other resources are listed below:

- Materials from the 2025 IMPS workshop titled *Bayesian psychometric
  modeling and blavaan*.

  [R](https://ecmerkle.github.io/pub/merkle_imps25.R)

- Materials from the 2024 NCME workshop titled *Bayesian latent variable
  modeling in education research*.

  [R](https://ecmerkle.github.io/pub/merkle_ncme24.R)

- The [lavaan resources page](http://lavaan.ugent.be/resources/index.md)
  is helpful for model specification examples; it is mostly the same
  specification that is used in blavaan, and the main blavaan commands
  just add the letter “b” to the start of the main lavaan commands.

- Many recorded presentations are available on the internet:

  - The longest talk with the most details: [Presentation to the Oslo
    UseR Group,](https://youtu.be/xJy5zIkzgvg) including real-time
    coding examples near the end. (Code from those examples is
    [here.](https://ecmerkle.github.io/pub/merkle_oslo_script.R))

  - Details about how the package works: [A virtual
    presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm6oP_Ss6qg) to the
    [2022 International Workshop on Psychometric
    Computing.](https://www.psychoco.org/2022/)

  - [An episode of the Learning Bayesian Statistics
    podcast,](https://learnbayesstats.com/episode/102-bayesian-structural-equation-modeling-causal-inference-psychometrics-ed-merkle/)
    discussing blavaan and related topics.

  - Basic overview of the package: [useR! 2020 virtual
    presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWA43-6taNA) (done
    early in the pandemic, and demonstrating the author’s poor video
    editing skills.)

- Slides from an [hour-long seminar
  presentation](https://ecmerkle.github.io/pub/Merkle_msu21.pdf) to the
  Michigan State Methods Group, October, 2021.

- Slides (blavaan and others) from a [symposium on the lavaan
  ecosystem](https://osf.io/bcy78/) at the 2019 International Meeting of
  the Psychometric Society, Santiago, Chile.
