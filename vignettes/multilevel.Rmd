Starting with version 0.5-1, *blavaan* supports two-level SEM with random intercepts. 
The specification and estimation commands are similar to those of *lavaan*, including use of `level:` in the model specification and use of the `cluster` argument for estimation. Consequently, examples involving *lavaan* also generally apply to *blavaan*, such as the *lavaan* tutorial example below.

```{r ex1, eval = FALSE}
data(Demo.twolevel, package = "lavaan")

model <- '
    level: within
        fw =~ y1 + y2 + y3
        fw ~ x1 + x2 + x3
    level: between
        fb =~ y1 + y2 + y3
        fb ~ w1 + w2
'

bfit <- bsem(model = model, data = Demo.twolevel, cluster = "cluster")
```

Below, we discuss what is currently covered by *blavaan* and some features that are unique to Bayesian modeling.

### *blavaan* Coverage
As of version 0.5-1, *blavaan* handles two-level, random intercept models for complete, continuous data. Handling missing data (assuming missingness at random)  will come in a future release. In the meantime, multiple imputation might be used in combination with the current *blavaan* functionality (though there is not currently an automatic way to do it). Alternatively, if there is not much missing data and it occurs only for lower-level units, listwise deletion could work.

The *blavaan* approach to model estimation mimics the *lavaan* approach, which uses matrix results [see @ros21] that enable us to efficiently evaluate the multilevel SEM likelihood. This will often lead to more efficient MCMC estimation, as compared to sampling all the level 1 and level 2 latent variables and working with conditional likelihoods [see @merfit21 for discussion of marginal vs conditional likelihoods].

Similar to single-level models, users can sample latent variables using the `save.lvs = TRUE` argument in their `bcfa/bsem/bgrowth/blavaan` commands. Marginal information criteria (marginal over all latent variables) are also automatically computed, with these information criteria generally being preferred over those than condition on latent variables [see @merfur19 for detail in the context of single-level models].

### Bayes-specific Options
All Bayesian models require prior distributions. The previous *blavaan* defaults for single-level models are now used for two-level models. You can continue to use commands like `dpriors(lambda = "normal(1,.5)")` to specify a Normal(1,.5) prior for all factor loadings and, for two-level models, that specification will apply to both the level 1 and level 2 loadings. Depending on the model, it may also be useful to specify priors on individual parameters via the `prior()` argument inside the model specification syntax. The default prior distributions do not always work well for observed variables whose values are far from 0. We continue to encourage users to consider their own prior distributions, possibly using the `prisamp = TRUE` option to draw samples from the prior (which could be further used for prior predictive checking).

Model checking also differs between Bayesian and frequentist methods. Just like it did for one-level models, *blavaan* reports a posterior predictive p-value for general model assessment. This is computed by comparing the marginal likelihood of the observed data (marginal over all latent variables) to the marginal likelihood of artificial data, for each iteration of MCMC sampling. For finer-grained model assessment, we encourage users to try `ppmc()`. It allows you to compute a posterior predictive p-value using your own, custom model assessment (defined as an R function).

### Concluding Thoughts
We think that the new *blavaan* functionality provides a viable option for Bayesian two-level SEM, and it should provide a solid base for future model developments. As always, the underlying Stan files and supporting data are available via the `mcmcfile = TRUE` argument, and all the *blavaan* code is available on Github. Bug reports are appreciated, either at the *blavaan* Google group or as a Github issue.
